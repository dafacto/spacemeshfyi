      <p>
        <strong>Spacemesh.fyi</strong> is intended to be one’s first contact
        with the <strong>Spacemesh</strong> blockchain project.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s objective is to provide enough information in five-minutes to allow
        the reader to decide whether to continue their exploration, and how to
        go about doing that.

      <h2 id="whatisspacemesh">What is Spacemesh?</h2>

      <p>
        <a href="https://spacemesh.io">Spacemesh</a> is a novel L1 blockchain,
        that uses <strong>Proof of Space &amp; Time</strong> (PoST) as its
        consensus mechanism.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whereas Bitcoin uses “Proof of Work”, how much computer work you
        provide, and Ethereum uses “Proof of Stake”, how much ETH you have
        locked, Spacemesh participation is based on—<em
          >how much computer disk space you dedicate exclusively to the network
          over time</em
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Spacemesh consensus protocol is operated by miners—also known as
        “Smeshers”—who:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <em>Dedicate space</em> —&nbsp;Create and maintain cryptographic data
          known as “postdata”, which might range from a few GB, to many TBs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Run nodes</em> — Run Spacemesh nodes which participate in the two
          consensus protocols, known as Hare and Tortoise, by periodically—each
          two weeks—proving they have dedicated their postdata over that period
          of time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Earn rewards</em> — For their participation, Smeshers receive
          rewards in the form of the SMH coin, in proportion to the amount of
          postdata they have dedicated to the network.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        An important difference between Spacemesh and other PoST blockchains, is
        that every Smesher, regardless of size, has an equal chance of receiving
        their fair share of rewards—a feature intended to motivate large numbers
        of home miners, resulting in decentralization comparable to Bitcoin.
      </p>

      <p>
        The project was started and received its initial funding in 2018, and
        launched its mainnet in July of 2023.
      </p>

      <h2 id="intendedutility">Intended utility</h2>

      <p>
        Unlike Bitcoin, Spacemesh is not targeting the money/currency use case,
        in which SMH would be used for payments.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead, Spacemesh intends to implement a “Virtual Machine”, which
        supports <strong>smart-contracts</strong>, such that it would compete
        with blockchains like Ethereum as a
        <strong>global decentralized computer</strong>, on which businesses
        could build and operate decentralized applications (dApps).
      </p>

      <h2 id="tokenomics">Tokenomics</h2>

      <p>
        The Spacemesh
        <a href="https://spacemesh.io/blog/spacemesh-economics-intro/"
          >tokenomics model</a
        >
        was inspired by Bitcoin, i.e. the large majority of coins are fairly
        allocated to miners, with a small percentage (about 6%) allocated to the
        team and initial investors, over a period of 875 years.
      </p>

        The following is a much-simplified explanation of the Spacemesh protocol
        and mining. See the

          >Smesher’s Guide</a
        >
        for the nitty gritty details.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Consensus operation</strong> —&nbsp;The Spacemesh consensus
          mechanism is based on two protocols operated by
          <em>eligible nodes</em>:

          <ul>
            <li>
              “Hare” — the fast organization of “layers”, containing blocks of
              transactions.
            </li>
            <li>
              “Tortoise” — the slower, ultimate ratification of the blockchain
              state.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Epochs</strong> — Since “time” is an aspect of its consensus
          mechanism, Spacemesh activities happen within two-week cycles, known
          as “epochs”. For a smeshing node to participate and earn rewards in a
          given epoch, it must have established its eligibility in the
          <em>previous</em> epoch by publishing a “Proof of Space &amp; Time”
          (PoST).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>PoST Init</strong> — The first job of a smeshing node,
          however, is to create its cryptographically dedicated computer space,
          known as “postdata”—a process in which a unique node identifier is
          additionally created associated with that data. This process requires
          a GPU, and can take a lengthy period of time. After the data has been
          created, the node registers its data and ID with the network in a
          process known as “PoST Init”. At this point, it’s known by the network
          and ready to start participating.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Eligibility</strong> — A node establishes eligibility for
          participation in the <em>subsequent</em> epoch by interacting with
          “PoET” (Proof of Elapsed Time) servers, during a 12-hour window in the
          <em>current</em> epoch, known as the “Cycle Gap”. During a Cycle Gap,
          a smeshing node will submit a proof to the PoET server that it
          maintained its dedicated disk space during the entirety of the
          previous epoch. Calculating that cryptographic proof involves the CPU
          and reading of the node’s postdata. This proof must be calculated and
          submitted within the 12-hour window. If successful, this establishes
          the node’s eligibility to participate in, and receive rewards, in the
          <em>subsequent</em> epoch.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3 id="howcaniminesmh">How can I mine SMH?</h3>

      <p>
        If you are interested in running a smeshing node and earning SMH
        rewards, you have two choices.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Smapp</strong> —&nbsp;The project’s desktop application which
          combines three capabilities—a node, “smeshing”, and a wallet. This is
          the intended application for the typical home miner, and
          <a href="https://blog.fabioiotti.com/posts/spacemesh-smapp-smeshing/"
            >this article</a
          >
          provides a step-by-step guide to setting it up.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>go-spacemesh</strong> — The project’s CLI software, intended
          for advanced miners who may be running multiple nodes on a single
          computer, and “smeshing” multiple sets of postdata. If interested,

          about how I run four nodes—one “public”, and three “private”—at home
          using a Mac mini and four external SSD drives.

      <h3 id="smhwallets">SMH wallets</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Smapp</strong> — Smapp is the project’s official wallet. The
          downside of using Smapp as a wallet, is that it’s also a full node,
          which has to be fully in sync in order to access your SMH funds. And
          that means keeping it running 24/7.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>SmeshWallet</strong> —
          <a href="https://smeshwallet.com">SmeshWallet</a> is a free web wallet
          created by the author of this document. It can additionally serve as a
          companion to Smapp, ensuring that your SMH funds are always available,
          even if Smapp is not fully sync’d.
        </li>
      </ul>

          members are not listed in the Discord (but do participate), those
          community members who have made contributions are given the role
          “Contributor” and tend to be the most knowledgeable.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Telegram</strong> —&nbsp;Two community Telegram groups, one in
          <a href="https://t.me/spacemeshen">English</a> and the other in
          <a href="https://t.me/spacemeshfr">French</a>, are operated by a
